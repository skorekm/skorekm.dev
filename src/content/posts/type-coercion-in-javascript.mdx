Picture this: it's Friday afternoon, and I am hunched over my laptop making a production release (because that's when it's supposed to happen, duh). I can almost taste the weekend — a cozy evening binging my favorite TV show. My code? Flawless. Or so I thought. But there it is, JavaScript starting a party I was not invited to:

```javascript
const myAge = "28";
const currentYear = "2025";
const iWannaRetireAt = 50;
const expectedRetirementYear = currentYear + (iWannaRetireAt - myAge);
console.log(expectedRetirementYear); // "202522" !?
```


My face goes stone cold, and my only thought is, "You serious!?" (I wanna retire at 50. Leave me alone).

If this sounds familiar, this article might be for you. Well, not the production release on a Friday bit. 
We all know it's forbidden. I meant the super realistic coercion example, 
which was definitely not made up for the purpose of the introduction. 
So, as you might have already guessed, we will dive into the secret sauce of JavaScript 
that made a lot of memes across the internet — Type coercion.

## JavaScript: Misunderstood Genius or Mad Scientist?

JavaScript type coercion is its way of transforming values from one type to another. Sometimes it's helpful. 
Sometimes, it makes you question your life choices. But understanding it can save you hours of debugging.

There are two main types: implicit coercion, where JavaScript does the magic for you, 
and explicit coercion, where you take the reins.

Okay, let's break this down.

## Implicit Coercion

It's JS's way of saying, "Don't worry, my friend. I have your back." It's with you for better or worse. It happens in arithmetic operations, logical contexts, and comparisons. Let's explore some examples.

### Arithmetic Operations

Have you ever wondered why **"5" + 2** gives **52**? Well, I am gonna spill the tea: in the early days, devs concatenated text more often than they did math. Therefore, **+** became a dual-purpose operator, and it can perform string concatenation and arithmetic additions.

Okay, in such a case, why does **-** act normal? Because subtraction makes sense with numbers, not strings.

```javascript
"5" - 2; // 3 (string → number)
"5" + 2; // "52" (number → string)
[] + 5; // "5" (array → string)
```

### Logical Contexts

In logical contexts, values become true or false. 
For instance, a non-empty string equals to true, 
while 0 is false. But what about "0"? Yep, it's true too!

```javascript
if ("hello") { / runs / } // non-empty string => truthy
if (0) { / does not run / } // 0 => falsy
if ("0") { / runs! / } // "0" is a string, party time!
```

### Loose Equality (==)

If the values have different types, JavaScript attempts to mediate by converting them to a common type before making the comparison. To be more precise, it tries to cast the values into a number.

```javascript
"5" == 5;       // true (string => number)
[] == 0;        // true (array => "" => 0)
"0" == false;   // true ("0" => 0, false => 0)
```

Extra note about null and undefined, they are equal, let's leave it like that.

```javascript
null == undefined; // true (this one is special case)
```

## Objects: Let's party!

When comparing objects to other values, JavaScript does not throw the towel but tries actually to figure this out. It goes through this routine:

1. It tries calling this particular method on the object **valueOf()**. This essentially asks, "Hey, what's your value?". If it returns a primitive (number, string, etc.), calm — all great.
2. Although, if **valueOf()** does not return a primitive (or a method does not exist), JavaScript tries a **toString()** method. It's a plan B called "Got it, how about you tell me what you look like as a string?"
3. But what happens if neither works? Well, the comparison fails.

Let's see some examples:

```javascript
const coolWord = {
  value: "Bazinga",
  toString() {
    return this.value;
  }
};

console.log(coolWord == "Bazinga"); // true

const someCounter = {
  count: 2020,
  valueOf() {
    return this.count;
  }
};

console.log(someCounter == 2020); // true
```

So, what happens when the object does not have those methods? Well, JavaScript cannot parse it to primitive, so it's always false.

```javascript
const someObject = {};
console.log(someObject.toString()) // "[object Object]"
console.log(someObject.valueOf()) // {}
console.log(someObject == 'something') // false
```

And what about arrays? They are objects under the hood, so the above rules apply. Quick examples:

```javascript
console.log([1, 2, 3] == "1,2,3"); // true [1, 2, 3].toString() => "1,2,3"
console.log([42] == 42); // true [42].toString() => "42" => 42
console.log([] == 0); // true [].toString() => "" => 0
```

## Explicit Coercion

Now that you have seen how JavaScript attempts to be helpful 
(like that one friend who swears they know a shortcut), 
let's talk about explicit coercion—when you grab the wheel and say, 
"Alright, I got this.". 
You can convert types using functions like **Number()**, **String()**, and **Boolean()**. Check this out.

Converting to a number? Easy peasy.

```javascript
console.log(Number("120")); // 120
console.log(parseInt("120px")); // 120 - ignores characters in the end
console.log(parseFloat("3.14someText")); // 3.14 - as above
```

Converting to a string? I got you!

```javascript
console.log(String(22)) // "22"
```

Would you like to convert it to a boolean? Be my guest!

```javascript
console.log(Boolean(1)); // true
console.log(Boolean(0)); // false
console.log(Boolean("Bazinga!")); // true
console.log(Boolean("")); // false
```

There's also this thing called bang (**!**), which is shorthand for converting to a boolean. You can use double bang (**!!**) as well.

```javascript
console.log(!"Bazinga!"); // false - A bang sign
console.log(!!"Bazinga!"); // true - Double bang
```

## NaN: The quirkiest of them all

So, what happens when JavaScript can't convert a string to a number? 
Well, it shows the "I give up" flag. So, **NaN** stands for "not a number". 
The irony? **NaN** is actually a number type. And here's a fun fact: **NaN == NaN** is **false**,
 because each **NaN** is unique.

Remember the example with **parseInt** and **parseFloat**? I have mentioned that it removes non-numeric characters from the end. What happens when you try to coerce a value that indeed has numbers but starts with a string? It becomes **NaN**. Let's go through the examples:

```javascript
console.log(typeof NaN); // "number" (yeah... no comment)
console.log(NaN === NaN); // false (they are all snowflakes, unique)
console.log(Number("Bazinga!")); // NaN
console.log(parseFloat("Bazinga123")); // NaN
console.log(parseInt("Bazinga123")); // NaN
```

## Love it or hate it, JavaScript coercion stays

Okay, here it is — JavaScript's type coercion in all its quirky glory. Sure, it can be confusing. Annoying? Of course. Fascinating? Duh.

Also, let's not forget about some of the weirdly useful things we get. Who did not create a conditional using **if(str.length > 0)**? Exactly…

So, next time JavaScript surprises you with **NaN** or anything weird, take a breath. Pour yourself a glass of water, and remember: coercion is not out there to get you. It's just trying to be its weird self.

Also, a pro tip: Use **===** unless you enjoy existential crises.

Till the next time, thanks!
